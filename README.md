# CourtScout

# 

# Find and join basketball games around you. CourtScout helps players discover nearby courts and open-gym events, see real-time crowd levels, and connect with other hoopers.

# 

# CourtScout is an Android app (Kotlin + Jetpack Compose) backed by Firebase. 

# Users can browse courts on a map, view detailed court profiles (photos, amenities, hours, surface), check current crowd levels, rate and comment on courts and events, and post team needs (e.g., “Need 2 more players for 3×3 at 18:30”). 

# Nearby players receive notifications so a good game is always one tap away.
